"""Tracks the in-flight agent-speech task so a fresh caller turn can cancel it.

BACKEND_COMPLETION.md Sec3.2: the moment VAD emits a fresh speech_started while
the agent is speaking, the orchestrator must cancel the in-flight TTS
generation and stop sending further audio immediately. ActiveSpeech is the
"is the agent currently talking" state that didn't exist before - deliberately
kept free of asyncio.Task's caller (main.py's speak()/handle_conversation_turns)
so the cancellation bookkeeping itself is unit-testable without a websocket,
VAD, or TTS model.

    Echo cancellation in the browser is enabled and mostly works, but what
    leaks through is the agent's own sentence - and unlike background noise it
    transcribes to real words, so "is the transcript empty" does not catch it.
    What does catch it is that the words are the ones the agent just said.

    THE HARD PART IS NOT DETECTING ECHO, IT IS NOT DETECTING A REPLY. A caller
    answering a question reuses the question's words - that is what answering
    is. Measured live: the agent asked "எந்த department-க்கு வேணும்?" and the
    caller said "Cardiology department வேணும் சார்", which is 3 of 4 words the
    agent had just said. Word overlap alone threw the caller's answer away.

    What separates them is NEW CONTENT. An answer carries the thing being
    answered - "Cardiology" - while echo is the agent's own sentence coming
    back with nothing added. So a transcript is echo only when it is BOTH
    mostly the agent's words AND brings essentially nothing of its own.

    Deliberately a containment test rather than a similarity ratio: the ASR
    mangles its own re-heard audio, dropping and merging words, so echo is
    usually a SUBSET of what was said rather than a close match of the whole.
    That is also why one unmatched word is tolerated - a garbled echo often
    produces one - but two mean the caller is saying something.

    A short transcript is never judged an echo. "ஆமாம்" ("yes") is one word,
    it will appear in something the agent said sooner or later, and refusing
    to hear a caller say yes is far worse than occasionally acting on an echo.

    FILLERS ARE THE ONE EXCEPTION to that, and only when `filler_text` is
    given - which main.py does only for an utterance that BEGAN while a filler
    (filler.py) was still audible. A filler is one or two words ("சரி சார்…"),
    so its echo is always short and would otherwise pass as a caller turn, and
    the agent would answer its own "சரி". A transcript made of nothing but the
    filler's words, heard while the filler was playing, is that echo. The cost
    is a caller who says exactly "சரி" in the second after their own turn
    ended, over the agent's acknowledgement - which answers nothing anyway.

    The filler is deliberately NOT part of `agent_text`: adding "சரி"/"சார்"
    to the agent's words would make a caller's real answers look more like
    echo on every later check.
