"""Streaming TEN VAD segmentation for signed 16-bit PCM audio.

Same turn-taking state machine as the reference live-mic pipeline: pre-roll is
collected only while silent, so an utterance is exactly
`pre_roll_frames` of lead-in silence + every frame from VAD onset through the
`endpoint_silence_frames` silent tail that closes the turn.

Two debounces sit on top of raw TEN VAD, because one flagged 16 ms hop is not
a human turn. Measured over the 87 real captured turns in call_events.db, 46
transcribed to <=3 characters and 34 to the EMPTY STRING - 39% of everything
the VAD opened held no speech at all, and each of those still ran the ASR and
could cancel the agent mid-sentence.

  onset   `vad_start_frames` consecutive flagged hops before a turn opens.
          The candidate frames are KEPT and prepended, so confirming an onset
          delays the turn by at most 64 ms and never clips a syllable.
  resume  `vad_resume_frames` consecutive flagged hops to restart the endpoint
          countdown. Resetting on a single hop is what let background noise
          hold the microphone open indefinitely.

A third gate, LOUDNESS, decides two things and it is worth being exact about
which, because this docstring used to claim it was read "in exactly one place,
the not-yet-in-speech branch" and that is not what the code does:

  onset      a turn may not OPEN unless the frames are loud relative to the
             room. This is the gate that keeps a television or a conversation
             across the room from starting a turn.
  countdown  once a turn is open, only a LOUD flagged frame restarts the
             endpoint countdown, and `vad_quiet_endpoint_frames` of nothing
             loud ends the turn whatever the VAD is flagging. That watchdog is
             deliberately TWICE endpoint_silence_frames; settings.py refuses to
             start if they are equal.

So the honest version of the rule is: loudness may refuse to start a turn, and
it may end one only after twice the silence window. What it may never do is
count as silence frame-for-frame. An energy gate applied to every frame that
way was tried here and reverted: a quiet trailing syllable scored as silence,
the endpoint countdown ran on through the middle of a word, and turns came back
as one-character transcripts.

The watchdog was not there for tidiness. Once the agent has spoken, residual
echo and the browser's automatic gain control produce long runs of flagged
frames out of an empty room, and those runs kept restarting the countdown - the
microphone then stayed open to the 30 s cap. Observed live.
