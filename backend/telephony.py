"""Telephony ingress adapter: PSTN phone audio -> the same VAD/ASR/Conversation/TTS pipeline.

BACKEND_COMPLETION.md Sec3.3 recommends "Option A - managed media streams" as
the fastest way to bridge a real phone call into this backend: a SIP trunk
provider (Twilio Media Streams, Plivo Audio Streams, Exotel Voice Streaming,
...) answers the PSTN call and bridges its audio to a WebSocket you control.
This module is a code-complete adapter for exactly ONE concrete instance of
that option, modeled on Twilio Media Streams' publicly documented WebSocket
protocol (JSON text frames only):

    -> {"event": "connected", "protocol": "Call", "version": "1.0.0"}   (ignored)
    -> {"event": "start", "start": {"callSid": ..., "streamSid": ...,
                                     "mediaFormat": {"encoding": "audio/x-mulaw",
                                                      "sampleRate": 8000, "channels": 1},
                                     "customParameters": {...}}}
    -> {"event": "media", "media": {"payload": "<base64 mulaw audio>"}}   (repeated)
    -> {"event": "stop", "stop": {...}}
    <- {"event": "media", "streamSid": ..., "media": {"payload": "<base64 mulaw audio>"}}

IMPORTANT SCOPE NOTE: there is no real telephony vendor account/trunk in this
environment, so this cannot be live-tested end-to-end against a real phone
call - that is expected. What IS complete and unit-tested here is the entire
code path: auth, framing, u-law<->PCM transcoding, resampling, and wiring into
the exact same VAD -> ASR -> ConversationManager -> TTS orchestration that
backend/main.py's `/ws/audio` browser handler already uses (see
capture_browser_audio() there) - this module does not reinvent that
orchestration, it reuses it via the same app.state.* objects. Making a real
phone number ring through to this route is a deployment/vendor step (buy a
DID, configure a SIP trunk / TwiML `<Connect><Stream url="wss://.../ws/telephony">`
or the Plivo/Exotel equivalent to point its Media Streams webhook at this
route) that is outside what code alone can provide; the code itself is
complete and tested against synthetic payloads shaped exactly like the real
documented protocol above.

This module is deliberately self-contained (its own `APIRouter`, no edits to
main.py) so it can be wired in later with one `app.include_router(...)` line.
It expects the same `app.state.*` objects capture_browser_audio() already
depends on (asr, conversation, llm, tts, call_store, security, asr_semaphore,
tts_semaphore, settings) - it does not construct its own model instances, so
wiring this router into the existing FastAPI app's lifespan is enough to make
it work end-to-end with the real ASR/LLM/TTS objects already loaded there.

Codec/rate handling (BACKEND_COMPLETION.md Sec3.3): G.711 u-law at 8 kHz is
the telephony-standard codec, while VAD/ASR are hard-pinned to 16 kHz
(settings.py). `audioop.ulaw2lin`/`audioop.lin2ulaw` (stdlib) convert u-law
bytes <-> 16-bit linear PCM; `audio_transcode.resample_pcm` (also stdlib-free,
built this session) does the 8kHz<->16kHz conversion on either leg. Neither
direction touches backend/vad.py, backend/asr.py, backend/conversation.py,
backend/llm.py, or backend/tts.py - those are used exactly as they exist
today, unmodified.

Auth (BACKEND_COMPLETION.md Sec4): capture_browser_audio() checks a shared
secret via a WS query param before accept(), because a raw WebSocket client
cannot set a custom header on the handshake. Some Twilio Media Streams
deployments DO support a query string on the `<Stream url="wss://host/path?token=...">`
TwiML attribute, so the same pre-accept query-param check is tried first here
too. But not every SIP-trunk provider/deployment makes that easy to set up
(dashboards that only take a bare hostname, proxies that strip query strings,
...), so if no query param is presented at all, the connection is accepted
provisionally and the token is instead expected in the "start" event's
documented `start.customParameters` object (Twilio's TwiML supports
`<Parameter name="token" value="..."/>` inside `<Stream>`, which arrives
exactly there) - checked before any audio is processed. A query param that IS
present but wrong is still rejected before accept(), same as the browser
handler. Document/adjust this choice per whichever real vendor is eventually
wired in; both paths are exercised in backend/test_telephony.py.
