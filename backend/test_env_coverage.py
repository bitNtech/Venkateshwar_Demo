""".env.example must document every knob the code actually reads.

The promise this file guards is "you can change anything from .env". That
promise is not kept by the code being configurable - it is kept by the
configurable things being FINDABLE. A knob added to settings.py and never
written down is, in practice, not configurable: nobody knows it exists.

This is the cheap half of that. It cannot check that the documentation is
GOOD, only that it exists, which is the part that rots silently.
