"""Catches identifiers the agent states that no tool ever returned.

golden/main_prompt.txt's GROUNDING section is blunt: "NEVER invent or guess an
ID, price, slot, date, doctor name, room, phone number, email or timeline -
including the caller's own mobile number or MRN." Until now that was a rule
addressed only to the model, with nothing checking whether it held. It does not
hold: a small model reading this repo's few-shot exemplars will happily say
"ஒரு நிமிஷம் சார், system-ல check பண்றேன்..." and then read back an MRN and a
pair of appointment slots lifted straight out of the exemplar, having called no
tool at all. That is the single highest-consequence failure this pipeline can
have - a caller told a confident, wrong reference number - and it is invisible
in the transcript, because a fabricated ID looks exactly like a real one.

So this checks the only class of fact where "invented" is decidable without a
model: structured identifiers and phone numbers. Anything the agent says that
matches those shapes must already appear somewhere it could legitimately have
come from - a tool result, the ledger, or the caller's own words. Everything
else (prose, reassurance, clinical wording) is out of scope here and stays a
matter for the prompt and the evals.

This USED to say it was deliberately not a filter on speech, "because by the
time a clause is checked it has already been streamed to the caller". That
premise stopped being true: conversation.speakable() is now a pre-speech choke
point that every clause passes through before it is spoken, and it calls
ungrounded_identifiers() there. Observed live over the socket, the agent asked
for a mobile number, was given an age, and read out the phone number from its
own few-shot exemplar - this had detected it and logged an ERROR, and the
caller had already heard it.

The other half of that reasoning was real and still holds: withholding half a
sentence is worse than the fault, because dropping the middle clause of
"ஆமாம், MRN ARV-604417-னு இருக்கு. சரியா?" leaves "ஆமாம், சரியா?", which says
nothing. So a fabrication ENDS the turn on a plain request for the detail
rather than punching a hole in it. See conversation.speakable().

unbacked_action_claims() below is still report-only, and for the original
reason: the sentence it catches has no identifier to withhold, so there is
nothing for a choke point to drop.

    the prompt's standing facts - pass them in alongside this.

    Two roles are excluded, both deliberately:

    - The agent's own previous turns. An ID it invented on turn two must not
      become self-justifying on turn three.
    - The SYSTEM PROMPT. This looks wrong and is the whole point: the prompt
      carries the few-shot exemplars, and those contain a full worked example
      with an MRN in it. Counting the prompt as a source is what let the
      observed failure through - the model read back the exemplar's MRN having
      called no tool, and the check called it grounded because the exemplar was
      "in the prompt". The exemplars say in as many words never to reuse their

# The identifier check above answers "where did that number come from?". It
# cannot answer the question that turned out to matter more: the agent, given
# a chest-pain call and an address, says
#
#     "Ambulance அனுப்பிட்டேன், இப்பவே கிளம்பிடுச்சு."
#     (I have sent an ambulance, it has left right now.)
#
# and calls no tool. There is no invented identifier in that sentence - there
# is nothing for the check above to see - and it is worse than a wrong MRN:
# the caller stops looking for help because they have been told help is coming,
# and it is not. Three separate prompt fixes failed to make dispatchAmbulance
# fire (runtime_core.txt's EMERGENCY section, its GROUNDING section, and the
# pre-generation reminder in conversation.py), so this stops being a thing the
# prompt is trusted to get right and becomes a thing that is checked.
