"""Normalise what the Tamil ASR hears back into how the agent writes.

IndicConformer is a Tamil model with a Tamil character vocabulary, so it can
only ever emit Tamil script. A caller saying an English hospital word therefore
comes back transliterated - "appointment" as "அப்பாயின்மென்ட்", "department" as
"டிபார்ட்மெண்ட்" - and a dictated phone number comes back as Tamil NUMBER WORDS
rather than digits.

Measured, real model, ten phrases synthesised and transcribed round-trip:

    SAID   Cardiology-ல ஒரு appointment book பண்ணணும்
    HEARD  ஒரு அப்பாயிண்ட்மெண்ட் புக் பண்ணணும்
    SAID   என் bill-ல ஒரு charge தப்பா இருக்கு
    HEARD  என் பில்ல ஒரு சார்ஜ் தப்பா இருக்கு
    SAID   என் mobile number 98407 21534
    HEARD  மொபைல் நம்பர் ஒன்பது எட்டு நான்கு பூஜ்ஜியம் ஏழு இரண்டு ஒன்று ஐந்து மூன்று நான்கு

Three things go wrong downstream if that is passed through untouched:

  1. The transcript shown to a human reads as mangled Tamil, not as the
     code-mix that was actually spoken.
  2. The model sees a register that does not match the one it is asked to
     produce - every exemplar writes English hospital words in Latin script.
  3. A phone number spelled out in words is not a phone number. Nothing
     downstream can read it back to the caller or write it down.

The vocabulary here is CLOSED - it is a hospital desk, not open dictation - so
a lookup table is the right tool and a fuzzy matcher is not: fuzzy matching
over Tamil script would eventually mangle a real Tamil word, which is a far
worse failure than leaving one English word transliterated.

Only exact, whole-word matches are rewritten. Anything not in the table is left
exactly as the ASR produced it.

# Generated coverage, merged UNDER the table above.
#
# The hand table is small, and "small" is the real complaint: a caller who says
# a word nobody typed into it hears it come back as mangled Tamil.
# backend/scripts/build_asr_lexicon.py grows it WITHOUT anyone maintaining a
# list - it takes every Latin word out of golden/ (the prompt, the exemplars,
# the flow transcripts), speaks each one with the agent's own Tamil voice,
# transcribes it with the caller's own ASR, and records what came back. Add a
# department to the prompt and it is covered on the next build.
#
# Two properties make this safe to merge blindly, and both matter:
#
#   1. It is still EXACT, whole-word matching. HANDOFF.md Sec6c measured every
#      fuzzy/transliterating alternative and all of them corrupted ordinary
#      Tamil - "சொல்லுங்க" (tell me) came back as "silence". Going forwards
#      (English -> expected Tamil form) instead of backwards means a form no
#      English source produced can never be matched at all.
#   2. The builder REJECTS any generated form that collides with real Tamil
#      appearing in golden/, which is what stops the romanised-Tamil words in
#      the prompt ("aamaam", "anga") from teaching this to rewrite ஆமாம்.
#
# The hand table wins every conflict: these entries can only add coverage, and
# a missing or malformed file simply means the hand table alone, which is
# exactly the behaviour before this existed.
