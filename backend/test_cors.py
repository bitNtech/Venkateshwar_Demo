"""The dashboard is served from a DIFFERENT origin than this backend.

Without CORS its fetch of /api/health and /api/calls is blocked by the browser
and the whole dashboard reads as "backend down" - a failure with no server-side
symptom at all, which is why it is worth a test rather than a manual check.

Run in a SUBPROCESS, not with monkeypatch. main.py adds the middleware at
import time, because Starlette builds its middleware stack on the first request
and anything appended after that is silently ignored. So the only way to
exercise a given CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS is to import main.py in a process that had
it set from the start - which is also exactly how a deployment works.
