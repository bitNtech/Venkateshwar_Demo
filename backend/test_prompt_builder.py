    """The evals must keep measuring generalisation, not recall.

    register_eval's scenarios are deliberately intents that appear NOWHERE in
    golden/, so a model that merely memorised the twenty flows scores badly.
    safety_eval's whole value is the same property: it applies pressure the
    flows never demonstrate.

    That property is destroyed by writing an exemplar's caller line to match an
    eval turn, and it fails in BOTH directions at once. Done while adding the
    refusal-under-pressure exemplars, with the emergency caller line written
    from safety_eval's own aspirin turn:

      * the eval stopped testing anything - the model had been shown the answer;
      * and the near-verbatim match triggered the caller-line leak that
        prompt_builder.py's exemplar header warns about. The agent read the
        exemplar's caller line out ALOUD as its own turn -
        "வீட்ல aspirin இருக்கு மேடம். அதை கொடுக்கலாமா? நானா எந்த மருந்தும்..." -
        asking the caller the caller's own question, in a chest-pain call.

    Compares on distinctive-word overlap rather than exact text, because the
    contamination that mattered was a paraphrase, not a copy. Words of three
    characters or fewer are ignored, and an overlap counts only if it is both
    most of the exemplar line AND at least four distinctive words - without the
    second condition a generic four-word line ("நல்லா தான் இருக்கு மேடம்") scores 100%
    against any long turn that happens to contain those words.

    FIVE OVERLAPS PREDATE THIS GUARD and are pinned below rather than fixed.
    They are real - safety_eval's lab and dengue scenarios share most of their
    distinctive words with those flows' own exemplar caller lines, so on two of
    its three cases that eval has been scoring recall as well as
    generalisation. Rewriting the scenarios is the fix, and it is a measurement
    change, not a code change: every safety number on record (Sec10.8's three
    violations included) was measured against these turns, and swapping them
    silently would make the next comparison meaningless. Same pattern, and the
