"""Conversation Manager: routes a caller transcript through the assembled
prompt and the LLM, producing the agent's turn.

There is deliberately NO tool layer. The agent converses: it remembers what
the caller told it (the transcript is the memory) and answers from the prompt.
Measured on this box, sending the 22 tool schemas cost 1778 of 5290 prompt
tokens and dropped generation from 12.5 to 10.2 tok/s - about a fifth of the
time-to-first-word budget on a voice channel - while register_eval scored the
same scenarios 12/14 mechanically clean without them against 10/14 with them.

Per BACKEND_COMPLETION.md Sec3.1: the prompt is assembled per turn by
prompt_builder.py (condensed core + one flow playbook + that flow's exemplars),
and the ledger is real server-side state per connection_id - an in-process dict
for v1, since Redis only buys reconnect and multi-process, neither of which
exists yet.

stream_utterance() is the interface the live transports use: it yields each
clause as soon as it closes, so TTS can start speaking while the model is still
generating, then a final AgentTurn carrying the full text and the grounding
verdict for the turn. handle_utterance() is the same thing collapsed to a
string, for the eval scripts and tests that have no use for partial output.

        the model is idle while the caller is occupied - which is exactly long
        enough to pay the one cost that cannot be cached away.

        That cost is the first prompt evaluation. Ollama caches the evaluated
        prefix of a prompt, so the SECOND turn onwards is nearly free (measured

        underneath audio the caller is already listening to.

        Generates one token, which is the smallest amount of work that still
        forces a full prompt evaluation. The result is thrown away; the point
        is the server-side cache it leaves behind.

        Best effort by design. A prewarm that fails, times out or is cancelled
        must never affect the call - the turn that follows simply pays the cold

        changes only when the detected flow changes, and is byte-identical
        across the turns in between.

        That matters for one measured reason. Ollama caches the evaluated
        prefix of a prompt, and the cache is a prefix cache: mutate one word
        near the top and everything behind it is evaluated again. On this box,

        The live ledger is exactly what mutates - a tool returns an MRN and the

        whole prompt on every turn that learned anything, and twice on any turn
        with a tool call, since the prompt is refreshed inside the tool loop.

        The ledger still reaches the model, and still reaches it on the
        iteration right after the lookup (the PART 6 fix this must not undo) -
        it is just carried by _turn_facts_message() at the END of the message
        list, where changing it costs a hundred tokens instead of three

            Enforces the one turn-discipline rule the model still breaks: ONE
            question per turn. Prose has failed three times (LLM_STACK.md Sec9)
            - runtime_core.txt states the rule three ways in one line and the
            model asks two anyway.

            This is not a truncation of the reply. Measured against the real
            recorded calls in call_events.db, a two-question turn arrives as
            two SEPARATE clauses:

                | நீங்க ... இருப்பீங்களா சார்?
                | எங்கே ... போகிறீர்கள்?

            so the second is still unspoken when it closes and can simply be
            withheld. Later NON-question clauses are kept - the closing line
            ("desk-ல இருந்து call பண்ணுவாங்க") often follows the question,
            and dropping the tail wholesale would lose it.

            '?' is the same test backend/scripts/register_eval.py scores turns
            with, deliberately: one definition, so the guard and the eval
            cannot disagree about what a question is.

# Recency beats distance: a small model reliably drifts into pure English by
# the third or fourth turn even with the language rules in the system message,
# because those sit thousands of tokens back while the recent turns are the
# strongest signal. This rides immediately before generation, costs ~40 tokens,
# and is not stored in history - so it never accumulates across a long call.
#
# It used to have to open by naming "call a tool", because a speech-only
# instruction here read to the model as "produce speech now" and suppressed
# tool calling entirely. There are no tools any more, so that constraint is
# gone and the whole message is speaking rules - ordered by how often each is
# actually broken, measured with backend/scripts/register_eval.py on unseen
# scenarios, most-violated first rather than most important-sounding first.
