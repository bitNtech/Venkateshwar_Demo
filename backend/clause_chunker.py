"""Splits agent reply text into clauses for pipelined TTS synthesis.

Fed token-level LLM output (BACKEND_COMPLETION.md Sec3.2/Sec6 item 2):
conversation.stream_utterance() calls feed() once per streamed text delta as
it arrives, and each clause feed() releases is handed to TTS immediately,
while the model is still generating the rest of the reply. flush() is called
once the stream completes, to release the final clause (see _BOUNDARY_RE for
why feed() alone never closes it).

Scripted text that is already complete (the greeting, the stuck-model
recovery lines) goes through the same class in one feed()+flush() pair via
conversation.split_reply_into_clauses().

# stop arrived. Every later chunk is generated while the previous one is still
# being spoken, so they can wait for a proper sentence end and keep the better
